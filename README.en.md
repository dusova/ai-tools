## What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be defined as the simulation of human intelligence in a digital environment. It aims to equip computer systems with the abilities to think, learn, solve problems, and make decisions like humans. AI develops algorithms that mimic human behavior by leveraging disciplines such as big data, machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP).

AI technology has revolutionized many sectors today and has countless applications in various fields. For example:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Chatbots, virtual assistants, and text analysis tools that interact with human language.
- **Image Recognition:** Facial recognition systems, medical image analysis, object detection.
- **Autonomous Systems:** Driverless cars, robotic processes, drones.
- **Data Analysis and Prediction:** Algorithms that analyze large datasets and predict future trends.

## Why are AI Tools Important?
AI tools simplify complex technological processes, enabling users to benefit from AI capabilities. These tools accelerate the AI development process while making it accessible even to users without technical knowledge. Users without coding skills can develop AI-based solutions using drag-and-drop platforms or pre-built models.
